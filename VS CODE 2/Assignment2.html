    <p class="para">Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.[1] The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. See glossary of engineering.

        The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning "cleverness" and ingeniare, meaning "to contrive, devise".</p>

     <h3 class="head1" align="center">TYPES OF ENGINEERING:</h3>
     <p class="para">Engineering is a technique involved in creating a product that gives you an end to end solution to perform an activity.This activity could be designed to support a complete action of course or just to perform a part of course in the whole process.
        There are ideally six branches of engineering and they are:

        Mechanical
        Chemical
        Civil
        Electrical
        Geo technical
        Management

<h3 class="head1" align="center">COMPUTER ENGINEERING:</h3>
<p class="para">Computer engineering combines several disciplines of computer science and electronics to develop computer hardware and software. A computer engineer or computer software engineer learns to build everything from small circuits to large systems. This branch of engineering trains students to design, construct, and repair any digital system. From hardware to software, jobs in this field cover varieties of products and processes.
